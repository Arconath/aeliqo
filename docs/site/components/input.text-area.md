## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A labelled multi-line text area that keeps caret position and IME composition intact across updates. It emits draft and commit events; the host owns persistence and validation.

## When to use it

- You need more than one line of text, such as notes or a description.
- The field needs a label and a visible starting height.
- The host owns validation and persistence of the committed text.

## When to use a different component

- Use [TextField](/components/input.text-field/) when only one line is valid.
- Use [Form](/components/input.form/) when the text submits alongside other fields.

## Responsive behavior

Rows set the starting height. Keep the draft readable when the form narrows and preserve line breaks as it grows.
