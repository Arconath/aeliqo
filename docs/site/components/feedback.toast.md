## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Transient feedback shown while `open`, dismissed on a timer or by request. Important failures need a persistent home elsewhere; the toast only reports the host's result.

## When to use it

- Confirming an action that already finished, such as a save.
- The feedback is brief and can disappear without loss.
- Anything important also lives in a persistent place.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Alert](/components/feedback.alert/) for a message that must stay in the reading flow.
- Use [EmptyState](/components/feedback.empty-state/) when a region needs a lasting explanation.

## Properties and defaults

## Events

{{aeliqo:events}}

## States and failure handling

Relevant states:

{{aeliqo:states}}

{{aeliqo:outcome}}

Set `duration` to zero for a notification that remains visible until the host
or user dismisses it. Timed notifications are capped at 60 seconds; a
`danger` tone never dismisses on the timer. Keep a durable status or error
elsewhere if a user may need to read or act on it after the toast closes.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

{{aeliqo:keyboard}}

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

Allow long messages to wrap within the available width. Place transient feedback where it does not cover fixed task controls.
