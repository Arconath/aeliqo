## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Explains why a region has no content, with an explicit kind, heading, and message. An optional recovery button proposes a host action such as clearing filters.

## When to use it

- A list or panel has no records or no matches to show.
- The reason for the empty region should be named, not implied.
- Recovery needs a visible action, such as clearing filters.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Alert](/components/feedback.alert/) for a warning while data is still available.
- Use [Skeleton](/components/feedback.skeleton/) while the content is still loading.
