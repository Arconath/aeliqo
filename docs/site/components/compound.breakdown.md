title: 'Breakdown'
family: 'compound'
contract: 'Display host-prepared group metrics and contributing records; group selection is a host request.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Breakdown shows host-computed groups with values, record counts, and contributing rows. Use it when a total must stay traceable to the records behind it.

## When to use it

- The host has grouped metrics ready; each group needs a label, value, and count.
- Selecting a group should send its key to the host, not expand scope itself.
- Groups need their contributing records shown alongside the totals.
- Empty, partial, or stale groups need an honest displayed state.

## When to use a different component

- Use Comparison for a fixed set of chosen entities.
- Use Metric for one headline value without contributing records.
- Use Table when raw rows matter more than grouped totals.

## Responsive behavior
