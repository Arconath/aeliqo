## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Compare records across the declared feature columns in a native table. Exact cell values remain
available; include an identity field in the columns when readers need it visible.

## When to use it

- Compare entities across several fields side by side.
- Keep each cell tied to its row and column.
- Show exact values rather than color-encoded cells.

## When to use a different component

- Use Heatmap when color should summarize cell values.
- Use Relationship for declared edges between entities.

## Responsive behavior

At container widths of 30rem or less, the matrix keeps readable minimum column widths and scrolls horizontally inside its exact-data region. The surrounding page does not need to scroll sideways.
