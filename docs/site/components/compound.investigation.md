## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Investigation arranges a trend, baseline metric, event timeline, and record detail in one scope. Use it when evidence about an entity must be reviewed together without implying cause.

## When to use it

- An entity needs trend, baseline, and event evidence viewed in one place.
- The host supplies the visualization specs, datasets, and detail record.
- Missing trend or event data must surface an explicit message.
- Associations may be shown but never presented as causes.

## When to use a different component

- Use Explorer for routine browse, filter, and selection work.
- Use Trend or Timeline alone when one evidence view is enough.
- Use Detail when only the record fields matter, without evidence panels.
