## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

## Purpose

Show a measure across two dimensions as colored cells with a readable key. Exact cell values stay in the data table.

## When to use it

- Find hot spots across two categories, like team by weekday.
- Scan many cells at once through color.
- Keep exact cell values reachable without reading color.

## When to use a different component

- Use Matrix when exact table values matter more than color.
- Use CalendarGrid when one axis is calendar days.
