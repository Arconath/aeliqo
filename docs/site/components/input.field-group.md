## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Groups related controls under one legend with shared description and error text. It can disable the whole fieldset while each child keeps its own value and validation.

## When to use it

- Several controls answer one question, such as the parts of an address.
- The group needs one legend plus shared description or error text.
- You want to disable a whole set of controls at once.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Form](/components/input.form/) when the controls also need submit and reset behavior.
- Use [TextField](/components/input.text-field/) or another single control when there is nothing to group.
