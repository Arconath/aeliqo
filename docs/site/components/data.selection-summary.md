## Import and live example

## Purpose

Show what is selected: picked record keys or a server-side filter. Clear selection sends a request for the application to handle.

## When to use it

- Show a selected count next to a table or list.
- Distinguish chosen records from a server-side selection scope.
- Offer a clear action the host confirms.

## When to use a different component

- Use FilterBuilder when people need to change the filter itself.
- Use Table when browsing and selecting rows is the main task.
