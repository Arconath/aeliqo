## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A pair of date fields whose `start` and `end` properties the host can set. User edits update those
local properties and emit both dates with boundary and calendar meaning as one range value; the host
decides what to persist.

## When to use it

- You need a start and end date that stay consistent together.
- The range must declare whether its endpoints are inclusive or exclusive.
- Timezone and calendar policy must travel with the submitted value.

## When to use a different component

- Use [DateField](/components/input.date-field/) when only one calendar date is needed.
- Use [Form](/components/input.form/) when the range submits alongside related fields.

## States and failure handling

{{aeliqo:outcome}}

Changing the range or its boundary policy or replacing `validator` cancels validation for the
previous value and clears its validator-owned error. An independently supplied
host `error` survives the change. Late results after a reset or disconnect are
ignored.

The range is invalid when a required endpoint is missing or the endpoints are
out of order. Inclusive ranges allow equal endpoints; exclusive ranges require
the start to precede the end. The event detail includes both dates, the
boundary policy, `timezone: 'calendar'`, `calendar: 'gregory'`, and validity.
An ordinary native form and [Form](/components/input.form/) both contribute
`${name}[start]` and `${name}[end]` when the named pair is valid and enabled.
Host updates and reset update both endpoints together; an invalid or disabled
pair contributes neither endpoint. The host carries the boundary and calendar
policy into any query or action.

## Responsive behavior

Stack start and end fields in a narrow form. Keep each label and the range boundary meaning next to its value.
