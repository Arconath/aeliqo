## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A short list of app-supplied commands with roving keyboard focus. Selecting an item emits its ID; your app performs the action and controls open state.

## When to use it

- An overflow or actions button on a row or record.
- A few explicit commands, some possibly disabled.
- Command lists that must stay fully keyboard operable.

## When to use a different component

- Use Popover for details or content that isn't a command list.
- Use TreeNav for hierarchical navigation instead of flat commands.
