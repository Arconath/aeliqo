contract: 'Task-based steps, draft continuity, validation and reversible navigation before commit.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

FormFlow walks users through named steps while retaining field drafts across navigation and
validating each step before commit. The host supplies `draft` and `activeStep` and owns durable
persistence.

## When to use it

- A task splits into named steps users move through forward and back.
- Each step must validate before the next step or the commit runs.
- Draft values must carry across steps and keep focus stable.
- Commit is a host proposal; the flow never applies the effect itself.

## When to use a different component

- Use Form when every field fits on one screen.
- Use RecordEditor when save must carry an existing record's key and revision.
- Use Dialog for a short confirmation, not a stepped task.

## Responsive behavior

Keep the step label, validation, draft, and navigation in DOM order. Let the flow become one column as space decreases.
