## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Shows one person's image, with initials as fallback when the image is missing or fails. Set `alt` on meaningful images; mark it `decorative` only when nearby text already names the person.

## When to use it

- Showing who created or owns a record, comment, or message.
- A compact identity cue in a list row, header, or byline.
- Cases where a remote image may fail; initials cover the fallback.

## When to use a different component

- Use Text when the person's name must always stay visible.
- Use RecordList when each row needs record fields, not only identity.

## Responsive behavior

Avatar uses its selected size. Pair it with wrapping identity text when initials alone do not fit the narrow layout.
