## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A bounded set of native radio options under one legend. The host can set `value` to the selected
option; choosing an enabled option updates it locally and emits a typed change. Its selected value is
available to form submission. Disabled options stay visible, and the host decides what to persist.

## When to use it

- People must select exactly one of a few named options.
- Every option should stay visible without opening a list.
- Some options can appear disabled without being removed.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Select](/components/input.select/) when the list should stay collapsed to save space.
- Use [Checkbox](/components/input.checkbox/) controls when several options can be selected independently.

## Responsive behavior

Vertical orientation suits narrow forms. Let long option labels wrap without changing their stable IDs.
