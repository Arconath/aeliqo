## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A native button for one explicit action. It emits a cancellable action event; your app performs the work and clears `pending`.

## When to use it

- Submitting a form, saving a record, or confirming a step.
- An action your app must be able to cancel before it runs.
- Actions that must not double-submit while `pending` or `disabled`.

## When to use a different component

- Use Link when activation navigates to another page.
- Use IconButton for a compact icon action with its own accessible name.

## Responsive behavior
