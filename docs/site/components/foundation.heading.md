## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A heading at the document level you set, with visual size chosen separately. Changing `size` never changes the level announced to assistive technology.

## When to use it

- Titling a section in the document outline.
- Keeping the outline truthful when the design needs a different size.
- Any heading screen readers should announce at a fixed level.

## When to use a different component

- Use Text for body copy and non-heading strings.
- Use Separator for a visual boundary that isn't a title.
