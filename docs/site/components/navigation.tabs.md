contract: 'Named panels with stable selection; automatic activation only when latency permits.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Switches between named panels with one selected value. `activation='manual'` waits for Enter or Space when changing panels is expensive.

## When to use it

- Switching between sibling views inside one page.
- Panels keyed by stable IDs your app controls.
- Costly panel loads that call for `activation='manual'`.

## When to use a different component

- Use Breadcrumb to show a path to the current location.
- Use Menu for a list of commands, not panel switching.
