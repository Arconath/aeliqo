## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

QualityPanel reports a view's source, freshness, completeness, provenance, and unsupported claims. Use it when people must judge how much to trust the data.

## When to use it

- A view must disclose where its data came from and when it refreshed.
- Completeness and provenance need a dedicated, labeled surface.
- Unsupported claims must stay visible as cautions, never as facts.
- Missing metadata should appear as not supplied rather than disappear.

## When to use a different component

- Use Alert for one warning that needs immediate attention.
- Use Badge for a single freshness or status label.
- Use KeyValue or Detail for general record fields, not quality metadata.
