## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A modal dialog that contains focus while open. Escape and the close button follow the dismissal policy and emit a request; the host owns the action inside.

## When to use it

- The person must confirm or cancel before continuing.
- The content needs a modal focus boundary.
- Focus should return to the trigger when the dialog closes.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Drawer](/components/feedback.drawer/) for detail that should sit beside the current page.
- Use [Alert](/components/feedback.alert/) when the message belongs inline in the page.
