contract: 'Provide consistent bounded chrome; never impose dashboard cards on every control.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Group slotted content in a labelled section with a chosen surface tone. The wrapper adds visual containment and optional section labelling; it does not turn child content into an action or a data card.

## When to use it

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

## When to use a different component

Use Stack or Grid to arrange children. Surface groups content and applies a tone without choosing its layout.

## Properties and defaults

{{aeliqo:properties}}

## Events

{{aeliqo:events}}

## States and failure handling

Relevant states:

{{aeliqo:states}}

{{aeliqo:outcome}}

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

{{aeliqo:keyboard}}

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

Surface follows the width of its parent and adds no columns. Put layout breakpoints on the containing Stack or Grid.

## Style hooks

{{aeliqo:style-hooks}}

{{aeliqo:performance}}
