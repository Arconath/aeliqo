## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show change over time as a filled area so magnitude stands out. Stacking requires measures that add together legitimately.

## When to use it

- Emphasize total magnitude over time, not only direction.
- Stack series that sum to a meaningful total.
- Keep missing values treated as the spec declares.

## When to use a different component

- Use Trend for change over time as a line without fill.
- Use Scatter to compare two measures per record.
