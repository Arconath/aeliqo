## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show rows and columns in a native table, with an opt-in grid mode for cell navigation. Sorting, paging, and selection are requests the application answers.

## When to use it

- Compare exact values across many columns.
- Sort or page rows while the host owns the data.
- Select rows by stable identity.
- Handle large result sets through bounded pages or virtualization.

## When to use a different component

- Use RecordList for compact browsing without column comparison.
- Use SelectionSummary to report a selection rather than display rows.
