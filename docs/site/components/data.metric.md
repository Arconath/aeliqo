## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show one labeled value with its unit and scope. A missing value reads as unavailable, never as an invented zero.

## When to use it

- Show a single KPI, count, or total on a dashboard.
- Report a value the application already computed and validated.
- Attach a unit, description, and scope to a number.
- Show an unavailable state when the value is missing.

## When to use a different component

- Use Delta to compare a current value against a baseline.
- Use Trend to show how a value changes over time.
