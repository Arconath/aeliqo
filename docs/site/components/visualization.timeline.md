## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Order dated events or intervals chronologically. Overlapping intervals get separate lanes; exact dates stay in the data table.

## When to use it

- Show events or spans in chronological order.
- Display overlapping intervals in separate lanes.
- Keep exact start and end times readable beside the graphic.

## When to use a different component

- Use CalendarGrid for a calendar-shaped layout of dates.
- Use Trend for a continuous measure over time.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

{{aeliqo:keyboard}}

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

At container widths of 30rem or less, exact-data rows become stacked records so labels remain readable inside narrow desktop panels as well as mobile pages. The graphic keeps its declared dimensions inside a focusable scroll region instead of shrinking its text to fit. Tab to the region to access its overflow; exact values remain available below.
