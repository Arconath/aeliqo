## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show the fields of one selected record as labeled facts. Missing fields stay visible, and record identity persists across views.

## When to use it

- Show every declared field of the record a person selected.
- Keep missing fields visible instead of omitting them.
- Display record identity next to a list, table, or editor.

## When to use a different component

- Use KeyValue for a short fact list without record identity.
- Use RecordEditor when the task is editing the record through a form.
