## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A short status or category label with a supporting tone. The text carries the meaning; color only supports it.

## When to use it

- Marking a record as Draft, Paid, or another short status.
- Tagging a category beside a title or inside a list row.
- Labels where color can support but never replace the text.

## When to use a different component

- Use Alert for a message that needs attention or action.
- Use Text for ordinary copy that isn't a status marker.

## Responsive behavior

Allow a row of badges to wrap when labels grow. Keep the status text visible; color alone does not carry its meaning.
