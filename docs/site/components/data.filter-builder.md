title: 'FilterBuilder'
family: 'data'
contract: 'Typed predicates, AND/OR/null handling, visible inherited scope and explicit query application.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Build filter clauses from allowed fields and operators. Apply emits a request; the application authorizes and runs the query.

## When to use it

- Let people compose typed field clauses with AND/OR logic.
- Keep inherited filters visible next to the local draft.
- Delay execution until an explicit Apply request.

## When to use a different component

- Use SelectionSummary to report the active selection instead of editing it.
- Use Table to browse and sort the filtered rows.
