## Purpose

Show a short ordered list of labeled facts as a definition list. Each fact can carry a description or a safe link.

## When to use it

- List a few stable facts like owner, status, or scope.
- Keep fact order fixed so labels stay predictable.
- Attach an approved link to a fact.

## When to use a different component

- Use Detail to show a selected record with identity and missing-field labels.
- Use RecordList when browsing and selecting records is the task.
