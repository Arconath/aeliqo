component: 'foundation.icon-button'
title: 'IconButton'
family: 'foundation'
contract: 'Named compact action with minimum target area; icon alone is never its accessible name.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A compact icon button with a native target and a text name from `label`. Your app owns the emitted action and its pending state.

## When to use it

- Toolbar or row actions where space is tight.
- Icon actions that still need an accessible name via `label`.
- Repeated compact actions, like row-level edit or delete.

## When to use a different component

- Use Button when the action needs a visible text label.
- Use Tooltip to add a hint; it cannot replace the `label` name.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

The icon target keeps its minimum hit area. Separate adjacent actions so their targets and focus outlines remain distinct.
