## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Two panes around a divider that users resize by pointer or keyboard. `min`, `max`, and `step` bound the range; changes emit a position request.

## When to use it

- A sidebar and detail view the user rebalances.
- Two regions that must stay usable within set limits.
- Layouts where keyboard users need the same resize control.

## When to use a different component

- Use Grid for a fixed responsive layout users can't resize.
- Use ScrollArea when one region needs bounded overflow scrolling.

## Responsive behavior

Set pane limits so each side stays useful. On phones, use vertical orientation if two side-by-side panes become too narrow.
