## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A contextual surface anchored to a trigger, with an explicit open state and dismissal policy. The host picks nonmodal or modal behavior; the component emits a close request, not an action.

## When to use it

- Small content or actions belong next to the element that opened them.
- The surrounding page should stay usable while the surface is open.
- Open, close, and dismissal need explicit host control.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Tooltip](/components/feedback.tooltip/) for a short explanation with no interaction.
- Use [Dialog](/components/feedback.dialog/) for a blocking decision that needs modal focus.
