## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Shows a path as an ordered list. Approved ancestor destinations are links; the current item is text.
Mark it with `current`; if none is marked, the final item is current.

## When to use it

- Pages nested under parents, like Reports → Weekly report.
- Letting users jump back up the hierarchy.
- Marking the current location inside a navigable trail.

## When to use a different component

- Use Tabs to switch between sibling views, not a path.
- Use TreeNav for a hierarchy users expand and browse.
