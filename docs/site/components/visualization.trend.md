## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show how a measure changes over time as a line. Gaps stay visible; exact values live in the paired data table.

## When to use it

- Track a measure like revenue or signups over time.
- Show change at the grain the spec declares.
- Keep missing periods visible as gaps, not filled points.
- Let people select a point tied to its source row.

## When to use a different component

- Use Area when filled magnitude or stacking is the point.
- Use Metric for one current value without a time axis.
