contract: 'Native submission semantics, draft validation, error summary and explicit host action; rerender never submits.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A native form boundary around slotted controls that emits a submit proposal after constraint validation. Invalid submits focus an error summary; a rerender never submits.

## When to use it

- Several controls submit together under one action.
- Native constraint validation should run before the submit proposal.
- Invalid submission should move focus to an error summary.
- The host performs the action and decides whether a reset is accepted.

## When to use a different component

- Use [FieldGroup](/components/input.field-group/) when controls need grouping but no submission.
- Use [FormFlow](/components/compound.form-flow/) when the task spans multiple steps before commit.

## States and failure handling

Relevant states:

{{aeliqo:states}}

{{aeliqo:outcome}}

Form data and constraint validation follow native disabled-fieldset rules.
Controls in the first legend of a disabled fieldset remain enabled unless
another disabled state applies; controls in later legends or the fieldset
body are excluded. A valid, enabled [DateRange](/components/input.date-range/)
contributes both named endpoints to the form data.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

{{aeliqo:keyboard}}

An invalid submit focuses the rendered error summary after a slotted submit
button click, Enter in a field, or `requestSubmit()`.

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

Stack fields and submit actions on narrow screens. Preserve DOM order and keep validation messages beside their fields.
