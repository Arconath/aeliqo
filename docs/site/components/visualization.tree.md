## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show a declared parent-child hierarchy as a tree. A structured data view keeps every node reachable without the graphic.

## When to use it

- Show org charts or nested categories with declared parents.
- Let people expand levels while selection stays stable.
- Offer a text outline when the graphic is too dense.

## When to use a different component

- Use Treemap when area should encode a value.
- Use Relationship for directed edges that are not strict parent-child.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

{{aeliqo:keyboard}}

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

At container widths of 30rem or less, exact-data rows become stacked records so labels remain readable inside narrow desktop panels as well as mobile pages. The graphic keeps its declared dimensions inside a focusable scroll region instead of shrinking its text to fit. Tab to the region to access its overflow; exact values remain available below.
