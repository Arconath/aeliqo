## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A native scroll viewport with an accessible label for overflow content. `axis` sets scroll direction; `tabIndex` controls whether keyboard users can enter the region.

## When to use it

- A panel or sidebar whose content overflows its bounds.
- Content that scrolls independently of the page.
- Regions keyboard users enter and scroll with arrow keys.

## When to use a different component

- Use SplitPane when two regions need a resizable divider instead.
- Use Surface for a labelled section that doesn't scroll on its own.

## Responsive behavior

Bound its height only when independent scrolling is needed. Keep enough visible space for keyboard scrolling at high zoom.
