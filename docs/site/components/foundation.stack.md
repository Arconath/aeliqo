## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Lays out children in reading order with the direction, gap, alignment, and wrap you set. Children keep their own semantics and focus order.

## When to use it

- Spacing items evenly along one row or column.
- Toolbars, button rows, or stacked form sections.
- Gaps and alignment from design tokens, not ad-hoc margins.

## When to use a different component

- Use Grid when items need rows and columns.
- Use SplitPane when two regions must be user-resizable.
