## Import and live example

## Purpose

Places children in the CSS grid you declare, without changing DOM or focus order. `columns` and `minItem` control how many columns fit.

## When to use it

- Cards, fields, or tiles that repeat in columns.
- Layouts that add or drop columns as the width changes.
- Grids where focus order must follow the DOM order.

## When to use a different component

- Use Stack for a single row or column.
- Use SplitPane when users must resize the two regions.
