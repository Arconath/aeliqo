## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A searchable choice field with separate local `query` and selected `value` properties. The host can
set the selected `value`; typing clears it, while choosing an option updates it and emits a typed
change. Late remote responses are ignored, so stale options do not replace current results; the host
owns query sourcing and persistence.

## When to use it

- People pick one option from a list too long to read at once.
- Typing a query should filter the option list.
- Options may load remotely and responses can arrive late.
- The query draft and the committed value must stay separate.

## When to use a different component

- Use [Select](/components/input.select/) for a short list that needs no query.
- Use [SearchField](/components/input.search-field/) when the query itself is the value and no option is committed.

## States and failure handling

Relevant states:

{{aeliqo:states}}

{{aeliqo:outcome}}

With a static `options` array, the component filters the bounded list as the
query changes. `optionsLoader(query, signal)` is the optional remote path: the
host owns the request and its authorization, while the component aborts the
previous load and ignores an older completion. At most 500 options are
accepted. A loader failure keeps the field visible, reports “Options could
not be loaded”, and never commits a different value. `minQueryLength` delays
loading until enough characters are typed.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

## Responsive behavior

Keep the query draft and selected value distinct at narrow widths. Test long option names against the visible viewport.
