## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

A labelled single-line text input with description and validation feedback. The host can set `value`
to supply or revise the draft; user edits also update that local property and emit typed change and
commit events. The host decides what to retain or persist.

## When to use it

- You need one line of free text, such as a name, email, or title.
- The field needs a visible label, hint text, or validation message.
- The value benefits from browser autocomplete or IME composition.
- You want to supply an initial value and receive typed draft changes.

## When to use a different component

- Use [TextArea](/components/input.text-area/) when the value can span more than one line.
- Use [SearchField](/components/input.search-field/) when the text is a query the host runs.
- Use [NumberField](/components/input.number-field/) when the value must stay an exact number.
