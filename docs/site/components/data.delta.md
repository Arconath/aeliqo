## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show the change between a current value and a baseline, as absolute, relative, or percentage-point. Incompatible inputs read as unavailable, not a misleading number.

## When to use it

- Compare this period against a baseline or a previous period.
- Show change as an absolute, relative, or percentage-point difference.
- Report movement where both values share the same unit and meaning.

## When to use a different component

- Use Metric when only one value exists, with no baseline to compare.
- Use Table when comparing many current-versus-baseline pairs at once.
