title: 'SearchResults'
family: 'compound'
contract: 'Query state, collection, scoped result count and details with stale-result protection.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

SearchResults binds a query, its result collection, a scoped count, and selected detail. Use it when results can go stale and that must stay visible.

## When to use it

- A query drives a result list, a scoped count, and an optional detail pane.
- Query and result revisions can diverge, so stale results need labeling.
- Selection must stay an identity request for a supplied row.
- The host owns running the search; the component reflects query state.

## When to use a different component

- Use RecordList when query revisions and stale handling are unnecessary.
- Use Explorer when filtering and browsing matter more than a query string.
- Use SearchField alone for query entry without a managed result view.
