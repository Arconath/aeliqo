contract: 'Declared edges/cardinality only; deterministic bounded layout with accessible adjacency view.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Draw declared edges between entities as a graph, with an edge table that keeps endpoint fields and selection reachable.

## When to use it

- Show declared connections such as reports-to or depends-on.
- Preserve edge direction and count from the supplied data.
- Use the edge table to inspect endpoint fields when the graph is crowded.

## When to use a different component

- Use Tree for a strict parent-child hierarchy.
- Use Scatter for two numeric axes; point position implies no link.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Keyboard behavior:

{{aeliqo:keyboard}}

Exposed semantics:

{{aeliqo:semantics}}

## Responsive behavior

At container widths of 30rem or less, exact-data rows become stacked records so labels remain readable inside narrow desktop panels as well as mobile pages. The graphic keeps its declared dimensions inside a focusable scroll region instead of shrinking its text to fit. Tab to the region to access its overflow; exact values remain available below.
