## Purpose

Plot records as points on two numeric axes. Nearby points suggest correlation, not causation; exact values stay in the data table.

## When to use it

- Compare two measures per record, like cost versus usage.
- Spot clusters and outliers across many points.
- Select a point that stays tied to its source row.

## When to use a different component

- Use Relationship for declared edges between entities.
- Use Trend when one axis is time.
