## When to use it

- Body copy, captions, or any ordinary trusted string.
- Text that must never be interpreted as markup.
- Strings needing muted styling or a specific element via `as`.

## When to use a different component

- Use Heading for a section title in the document outline.
- Use Badge for a short status or category marker.
