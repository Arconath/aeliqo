title: 'Treemap'
family: 'visualization'
contract: 'Nonnegative additive hierarchy; area meaning and tiny-node access preserved.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show a hierarchy as nested rectangles sized by a nonnegative measure. Tiny nodes stay reachable through the data view.

## When to use it

- Compare part-to-whole size across a hierarchy.
- Show breakdowns where areas must add up, like budgets.
- Keep tiny nodes reachable through the data view.

## When to use a different component

- Use Tree when labels and structure matter more than area.
- Use Heatmap for two flat dimensions instead of nested areas.

## Keyboard, focus, and accessibility

Exposed semantics:

## Responsive behavior

At container widths of 30rem or less, exact-data rows become stacked records so labels remain readable inside narrow desktop panels as well as mobile pages. The graphic keeps its declared dimensions inside a focusable scroll region instead of shrinking its text to fit. Tab to the region to access its overflow; exact values remain available below.
