## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Shows the current page with previous and next controls from host-supplied data. Activation requests a page change; the component never fetches rows itself.

## When to use it

- Lists or tables split into discrete pages.
- Moving forward and back through paged results.
- Keeping loaded rows scoped to the requested page.

## When to use a different component

- Use Table when the task is comparing records in columns.
- Use SearchResults for a full query-results view with count and details.

Exposed semantics:

## Responsive behavior

Keep page controls large enough to operate. Let the host trim visible page links on narrow screens without hiding the current page.
