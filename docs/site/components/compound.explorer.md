## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Explorer combines a filter bar, record list, and detail pane into one view with shared scope. Use it when browsing and inspecting records belong on the same screen.

## When to use it

- A record collection needs filter controls and a detail pane sharing one selection.
- Choosing a row should reveal its detail in place instead of navigating away.
- Filter and selection changes must reach the host as proposals, not silent mutations.
- The host owns rows, selection, and detail; the panels only coordinate them.

## When to use a different component

- Use RecordList alone when the view needs no filters or detail pane.
- Use Table when users scan many rows instead of inspecting one record.
- Use separate FilterBuilder, RecordList, and Detail when the app already owns panel layout.
