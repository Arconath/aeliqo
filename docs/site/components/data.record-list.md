## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

Show records in a compact, scannable list. Selection emits stable record keys; the application applies them.

## When to use it

- Browse records where reading order matters more than columns.
- Let people select one or more records by stable identity.
- Expose extra fields on demand while rows stay compact.

## When to use a different component

- Use Table when sorting, paging, or comparing columns is the task.
- Use CardCollection when each record needs a heading and card layout.

## Responsive behavior
