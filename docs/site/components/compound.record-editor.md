title: 'RecordEditor'
family: 'compound'
contract: 'Existing primitive form over a host-owned action with entity revision and explicit save/cancel.'

## Import and live example

{{aeliqo:fixture}}

{{aeliqo:example}}

## Purpose

RecordEditor wraps slotted fields with a record key, revision, and save/cancel actions. Use it when edits must carry version evidence to a host-owned action.

## When to use it

- An existing record is edited and its revision must travel with the save.
- Save must validate the fields first and emit a proposal, never persist directly.
- Cancel must emit the same record context so the host can discard cleanly.
- The host owns the action, conflict handling, and resulting effect.

## When to use a different component

- Use Form for submissions without entity identity or revision.
- Use FormFlow for multi-step entry with drafts and review.
- Use Detail for read-only record display.
