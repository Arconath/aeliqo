## Start with one useful result

The [React quickstart](/start/) describes five local People records once, then
asks four questions about them: everyone, one team, hires per month, and hires
per team. Aeliqo answers with a table, a filtered table, a line chart, and a bar
chart, without any table or chart markup from you. You need Node.js 24; no
account, backend, or model key is needed.

Use [What is Aeliqo?](/start/what-is-aeliqo/) for the concepts, or choose an
[integration path](/start/frameworks/) for React, Vanilla, Vue, and the explicit
Next.js server-rendering setup.

## When to use Aeliqo

Use it for data interfaces where the same records need different presentations:
lists and details, comparisons, forms, dashboards, or workspaces controlled by
application intent. It also supplies [standalone components](/start/standalone-components/)
when your screen already owns its interaction state.

Aeliqo becomes useful when validation, data identity, view selection, and state
preservation are recurring application work. A fixed marketing page or a one-off
illustration usually needs authored HTML and CSS.

## What your application registers

A resource describes the data and its meaning. A data adapter reads it. Your
application supplies current authority and allowed actions. Registered views
and recipes define how approved results appear. An adaptive region is the
container where a result is mounted.

Every request passes through validation, authorization, bounded data evaluation,
and rendering. An agent submits the same kind of request as application code;
it cannot supply executable UI or grant itself access. Your server still
checks real data access and business effects.

For production integration, continue with [existing applications](/start/existing-app/)
and the [advanced guides](/advanced/).
